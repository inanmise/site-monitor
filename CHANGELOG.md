## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-19

### Added
- **System Health — Heartbeat** — backend records a DB heartbeat every 10 minutes; alarm triggers if signal is missing for >15 minutes
- **System Health — SMTP Statistics** — 30-day delivery rate (sent/attempted); alarm below 99%; separate `countAttemptedSince` query excludes intentional SKIPPED_DISABLED entries from the denominator
- **System Health — SMTP Failure Modal** — clicking the SMTP card opens a modal listing all non-SENT notifications (FAILED + SKIPPED) with kind badge, error detail, recipient, and trigger
- **System Health — Database Stats** — DB response time (SELECT 1 latency in ms); sortable PostgreSQL table statistics (rows, table size, total size) with client-side column sort
- **System Health — DB Refresh Button** — dedicated refresh button reloads DB stats independently without reloading the full page
- **System Health — Certificate Scan Statistics** — last scan time, duration, total/warning/error counts tracked via atomic fields in SchedulerService
- **System Health — Scan Staleness Alarm** — red alarm banner when no scan has run for ≥2 hours
- **System Health — Alarm Banner** — consolidated red banner at page top when any alarm is active (scan, SMTP, heartbeat)
- **Audit Log — DOMAIN_EDIT event** — every domain edit records a structured JSON diff (`{"field":{"from":old,"to":new}}`) in the `detail` column; covers all 24+ CertificateInventory fields
- **Audit Log — Diff Viewer** — expandable row in Audit Log table shows field-level diff (old value in red, new value in green) for DOMAIN_EDIT entries
- **Audit Log — DOMAIN_EDIT badge** — amber/orange event badge distinct from create (blue) and delete (red)
- **`SystemHeartbeat` entity & repository** — new `system_heartbeat` table, auto-created by Hibernate `ddl-auto=update`
- **`ExtendedHealthService`** — new service encapsulating heartbeat recording, SMTP stats, DB latency, and table stats
- **`/api/admin/system/db-stats` endpoint** — returns PostgreSQL table statistics (row counts + sizes)
- **`/api/admin/system/smtp-logs` endpoint** — returns non-SENT notification records for the last 30 days

### Changed
- **Smart scan polling** — Check Now button polls every 2 s and detects completion via `running: true→false` transition OR `last_run` timestamp change (fixes race condition for fast scans)
- **DB table layout** — switched to `table-layout: fixed` with `<colgroup>` for stable column widths; added raw byte columns (`table_size_bytes`, `total_size_bytes`) for correct numeric sort
- **SMTP rate calculation** — rate now computed as `sent / (sent + failed)`, intentional SKIPPED_DISABLED records excluded from denominator
- **Audit Log table** — expanded from 9 to 10 columns; 10th column shows diff toggle button for DOMAIN_EDIT entries

### Fixed
- SMTP success rate showing 66% when SKIPPED_DISABLED notifications were incorrectly counted as failures
- Certificate Scan card showing "Not yet run" after Check Now due to polling race condition
- DB table column misalignment ("kaymış") resolved with fixed-layout table

- **Certificate inventory management** — add/edit/delete monitored domains via admin UI
- **Multi-level alerting** — WARNING / HIGH / CRITICAL thresholds with configurable day counts
- **Escalation contacts** — per-role contacts (PO, TECH, MANAGER, CLEVEL) with email and Teams/Slack webhook delivery
- **Alert lifecycle** — acknowledge, re-notify, and resolve alerts with full audit trail
- **OCSP/CRL revocation checking** via BouncyCastle
- **Chain validation** — detects incomplete or broken certificate chains
- **Fingerprint & Subject pinning** — detects certificate replacements
- **Activity log** — per-run timeline with per-certificate status
- **Notification history** — full log of every email/webhook delivery attempt
- **Dashboard** with clickable stat cards and filter support
- **Dark / Light mode** with system-preference detection and localStorage persistence
- **Internationalisation** — Turkish (default) and English UI, switchable at runtime
- **Lucide React icons** replacing all emoji throughout the UI
- **Kubernetes** deployment manifests (namespace, deployment, service, configmap, secret, ingress, HPA, PDB, ServiceAccount)
- **Helm chart** `helm/cert-monitor` v0.1.0 — fully parameterised via `values.yaml`
- **Multi-stage Docker build** with separate frontend and backend stages
- **Prometheus metrics** endpoint at `/metrics`
- **Remember-me** cookie authentication (7-day token, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict in prod)

### Security
- All credentials sourced from environment variables — no hardcoded secrets in code

- CORS restricted to explicitly configured allowed origins
- Container runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
- Read-only root filesystem in container
- All capabilities dropped in K8s pod security context
- TLS enforced via Ingress (`ssl-redirect: true`)
- `secret.yaml` excluded from version control (`.gitignore`); `secret.example.yaml` provided as template
- Docker Compose uses `.env` file — `.env.example` provided as template
